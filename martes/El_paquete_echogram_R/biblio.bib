	Movies+ est un logiciel de traitement des données de sondeurs de
	pêche à vocation scientifique. Il permet d'évaluer les quantités
	d'énergies rétrodiffusées (et donc in fine de biomasse) par tranches
	d'eau et par bancs de poissons. Ces bancs font l'objet d'une caractérisation
	poussée, morphologique et géographique afin de permettre l'identification
	autant que faire se peut, de l'espèce concernée. Il permet également
	l’analyse des index de réflexion des cibles individuelles de poissons
	ainsi que leur trajectographie.},

  abstract = {A simple and effective post-processing technique to estimate echosounder
	background-noise levels and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) during
	active pinging is developed. Similar to other methods of noise estimation
	during active pinging, this method assumes that some portion of the
	sampled acoustic signal is dominated by background noise, with a
	negligible contribution from the backscattered transmit signal. If
	this assumption is met, the method will provide robust and accurate
	estimates of background noise equivalent to that measured by the
	receiver if the transmitter were disabled. It provides repeated noise
	estimates over short intervals of time without user intervention,
	which is beneficial in cases where background noise changes over
	time. In situations where background noise is dominant in a portion
	of the recorded signal, it is straightforward to make first-order
	corrections for the effects of noise and to estimate the SNR to evaluate
	the effects of background noise on acoustic measurements. Noise correction
	and signal-to-noise-based thresholds have the potential to improve
	inferences from acoustic measurements in lower signal-to-noise situations,
	such as when surveying from noisy vessels, using multifrequency techniques,
	surveying at longer ranges, and when working with weak acoustic targets
	such as invertebrates and fish lacking swimbladders.},

	and edited data was adopted by the ICES-Fisheries Acoustics Science
	and Technology Working Group (WGFAST) in 1999. Since 2000, the ICES
	HAC Planning Group (PGHAC) has overseen modifications and additions
	to the format so that it would evolve to meet the needs of the international
	fisheries acoustics community. The present report is based on the
	original adopted version and consolidates into one document the various
	additions, modification, corrections and clarifications which have
	been vetted and accepted by the PGHAC in the intervening years and
	published in the ICES Annual Reports of the Planning Group on the
	HAC data exchange format. Through the work of the PGHAC, many improvements
	have been made to the format, including the correction of errors
	and imprecisions in previously described tuples, the clarification
	of rules and definitions for tuple syntax, for allocating tuple numbers
	and for software compliance and compatibility, the addition of new
	tuples containing information for a new generation of echosounders,
	for additional auxiliary sensors and for the complete series of generic
	tuples for data exchange. The work of the PGHAC and the evolution
	of the HAC standard format will continue after the publication of
	this document and future modifications will continue to be published
	in the HAC Planning Group Annual Reports.},
